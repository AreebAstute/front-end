# MAJOR UPDATE

Previously, the app was built on CRA. it has been updated to use Vite now.
A few notes to keep in mind.

1. Use .jsx extension for components. .js won't work.
2. Errors that failed silently on CRA, will not on VITE. Ensure to handle any unused code or warnings.
3. Use node version 22.9.0
