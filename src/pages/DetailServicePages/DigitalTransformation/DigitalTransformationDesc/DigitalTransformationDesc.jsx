                    Digital Transformation is fundamentally changing every business, from 
                    SMBs to the enterprise. Itâ€™s also how businesses
                    today are keeping pace with change. Not surprisingly, Digital 
                    Transformation is now a top three strategic priority in 11 out
                    of 15 industries. With every industry becoming a digital industry 
                    due to the growth of software-driven innovation and
                    multi-device adoption, it is estimated that by 2022 cloud services 
                    will be essential for 90% of business innovation.

                    The exponential growth and variety of data organizations collect 
                    opens an opportunity to harness this data to optimize
                    operations, create personalized consumer experiences, and launch 
                    new business models. Digital Transformation is
                    becoming a foundational change that enables data monetization, cost 
                    optimization, and business agility.
