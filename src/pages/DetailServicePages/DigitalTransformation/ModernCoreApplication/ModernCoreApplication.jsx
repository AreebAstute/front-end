                        Legacy applications have become one of the biggest impediments to
                        business agility and ability to compete in todayâ€™s digital economy. Many
                        companies struggle with revenue losses and operational inefficiencies

                        integrate with emerging technologies. Modernizing and Moving legacy
                        applications to the cloud offers several business-critical benefits:
